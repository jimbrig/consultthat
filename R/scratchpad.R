# milestone summaries folder
# SERIES OF pro forma docs that are downloaded on every initialisation of project
# on request~~~
# sample project initiation note
# sample data ingest form
#
# issue tracker function - add issues, mark issues checked functions

## Note: items added to the project package don't need file paths because
## You assume you're working in that package/project. YAY!


## Note on basic data documentation function
# the rmd is downloaded from a speicfic github commit. Need to keep up with this.
# have managed download, but cannot parse with parameters.
# suggest removing for the moment (new github commit link) and going again.
# might need to look at unparameterised .rmd for th emoment.

# Priority list
# note that the no visible global function definition for ... needs attending to
# call library at time of issue? Put something in namespace?
# vignette
# sample docs for the folders
