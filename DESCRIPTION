Description: Workflow tools for consultants using R.
    Setting up a new project can be time consuming for consultants. While there
    are many tools available to help you do this, if your workflow is primarily
    R based, it can be convenient to have a basic set of management tools available
    from R. Consultthat is built on top of Usethis and works on a similar principle:
    automate that which can be automated.
